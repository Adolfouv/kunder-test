## Kunder Banner (TestAngular11)
Application that consumes REST API services developed with Angular 11. In this exercise you have to get variables from an API web service.

CONSIDERATIONS

    To see the code open the project folder "nutrialusTest" from Visual Studio Code (recommended).
    The files where code was written are: -
                                          - product.service.spec.ts (inside "services" Folder) 
                                          - product.service.ts (inside "services" Folder)
                                          - app.component.css
                                          - app.component.html
                                          - app.component.spec.ts
                                          - app.component.ts
                                          - app.module.ts
FUNCTIONALITY

    The app its calling the API succesfully. Once the web navigator has opened the project;
                                          - Click (right-click) 
                                          - Select "Inspect"
                                          - Go to "Console"
                                          - There you can verify that everytime the app is reloaded, it calls a new "Object"

ERRORS

  The app its calling the API succesfully but its just capable to show data on "Console".
                                         
                                          
## To open project type in terminal:
